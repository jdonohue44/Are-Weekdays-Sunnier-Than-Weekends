# Are Weekdays Sunnier Than Weekends?
Analysis of 35 years of daily cloud cover data (1990-2025) from Central Parl, New York City reveals no statistically significant difference between weekday (55.19% ± 0.60%) and weekend (54.51% ± 0.94%) cloud cover (p = 0.23). 

While weekdays show a marginally higher mean (+0.68 percentage points), this difference is well within sampling variability and represents a negligible effect size. The large sample sizes (n = 9,133 weekdays, n = 3,652 weekends) provide sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences, yet the observed similarity persists across decades. From a causal inference perspective, this null finding does not rule out anthropogenic effects on local weather in Central Park, it simply suggests that if weekday human activities (e.g., traffic emissions, industrial processes) do influence cloud formation, their impact is either too small to detect at daily resolution, confounded by dominant meteorological factors, or exhibits temporal lags that obscure direct day-of-week patterns. Future work could employ more sophisticated causal frameworks (e.g., regression discontinuity, instrumental variables) or examine sub-daily cloud dynamics to disentangle potential anthropogenic signals from natural variability.
